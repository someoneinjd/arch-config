# Start Page
This is my startpage with tokyonight theme

## Commands
5 search commands are implemented.
To run them use the keyword /<letter> and type the rest of the string. Then press enter.
And if you only type the keyword, the browser will jump to the corresponding homepage.

* `/g` Searchs in google search (default)
* `/h` Searchs in github search
* `/d` Searchs in baidu search
* `/b` Searchs in bilibili search
* `/r` Searchs in reddit search

For example, typing `/h linux` will use github search engine to search for `linux`,
and `/h` will let the browser jump to `github.com`.
